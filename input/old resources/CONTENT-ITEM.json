  "description" : "Content of one version in a VERSIONED_CONTENT_ITEM. A Composition is considered the unit of modification of the record, the unit of transmission in record Extracts, and the unit of attestation by authorising clinicians. In this latter sense, it may be considered equivalent to a signed document. NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute uid be populated in Compositions, using the UID copied from the object_id() of the uid field of the enclosing VERSION object. For example, the ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid 87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2 would be copied to the uid field of the Composition.",
