  "description" : "Generic class defining an interval (i.e. range) of a comparable type. An interval is a contiguous subrange of a comparable base type. Used to define intervals of dates, times, quantities (whose units match) and so on. The type parameter, T, must be a descendant of the type DV_ORDERED, which is necessary (but not sufficient) for instances to be compared (strictly_comparable is also needed).\r\n\r\nWithout the DV_ORDINAL class, quite a few more DV_ classes would be needed to express logical intervals, namely interval versions of all the date/time classes, and of quantity classes. Further, it allows the semantics of intervals to be stated in one place unequivocally, including the conditions for strict comparison.",

Examples of sets of ordinal values:\r\n\r\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3  — reflex response values\r\n0, 1, 2  — Apgar values\r\nThis class is used for recording any clinical datum which is customarily recorded using symbolic values. Example: the results on a urinalysis strip, e.g. {neg, trace, +, , +} are used for leucocytes, protein, nitrites etc; for non-haemolysed blood {neg, trace, moderate}; for haemolysed blood {small, moderate, large}.",

DV_SCALE may also be used in future for representing purely Integer-based scales, however, the DV_ORDINAL type should continue to be supported in software implementations in order to accommodate existing data that are instances of this type.",
