  "description" : "The LOCATABLE class defines the pathing capabilities used by nearly all classes in the openEHR reference model, mostly via inheritance of LOCATABLE. The defining characteristics of LOCATABLE objects are that they can locate child objects using paths, and they know their parent object in a compositional hierarchy. The parent feature is defined as abstract in the model, and may be implemented in any way convenient.",
